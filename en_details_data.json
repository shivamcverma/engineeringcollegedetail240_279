              "Faculty": "The teachers are well qualified, but the problem is the course curriculum. The syllabus is from around 50-60 years ago, which is not competitive with the current generation. So it does not make students industry-ready for this generation. Coming to semester exams, the exams are above average, and the minimum pass percentage is 35% overall.",
              "Other": "They need to teach students only the necessary information that can help them get a job or compete with the current generation, and that helps them toward reaching their future goals, but not unnecessary content. There are some extracurricular activities conducted, like Sumshodini, which is an event where students can do projects and present them. But regarding scholarship, I have only received a one-year scholarship until now (2025)."

So in the 3rd year, they somehow managed to get an intern. The rest of the students are being tried for it, and do something not sure about it. I am not sure about the roles they are placed maybe like software engineers.",

Library is a good aesthetic place for pics. The overview may be good but not the others like hostel is not that good to say. But have both non-AC and AC hostels separately. Mess and canteen foods are sometimes horrible but it is good most of the time. Sports and games support from college is good enough to participate and go somewhere out for it.",

Our curriculum is sometimes tough and not relevant to the course as it is the first year we need to learn all the basics of other courses. Semester exams are not that tough if you study. Mostly the pass mark is like getting about 50 or something, not sure about that.",
              "Other": "This course is the main one in the next few years. Just thought of taking it so it could lead me to a good job and life. I need no change in the course and all but maybe in facilities they could change something. We will have 2 to 3 cultural events per year including annual day. Campus crowd is not as much as scheduled in a different manner, we don't gather together often. There are more scholarships for students like caste, marks, and something else."

The course curriculum balances core concepts with evolving teaching trends, though more industry-like projects and certification would be a great addition. Exams are concept-driven rather than written-based, challenging but fair. The overall pass percentage stays above 85%, showing solid academic support throughout.",
              "Other": "EEE drew me in because it sits at the crossroads of innovation, power, electronics, and automation all in one. The course trains us to think both logically and creatively. Perk labs curiosity, and faculty members push us to ask deeper questions. I'd love to see more startup exposure and interdisciplinary projects added. Electric fests are massive, clubs are passionate. Every corner has something happening. It is surrounded by nature but digitally connected, with a mix of cultures. For scholarships and sports, it is a great place to grow both technically and personally."

I am not currently aware of the roles.",

Students cannot use Wi-Fi inside the campus, and cellular data is blocked due to jammers. The rest of the infrastructure is good. The food is decent but not as good as home. The college has its own dispensary where students can get medicine for free. There is also a ground where students can play.",

              "Other": "I chose this college and course because it has the best placement record overall. Industrial visits can be improved to give students more knowledge. College fests happen once a year and totally worth it, with an amazing crowd to vibe with. As a 3rd-year student, I have been receiving a scholarship of Rs. 30,000 per year for the past two years.

Curriculum is academically rigorous yet enriching, combining legal theory with practical application. Papers cover a broad spectrum of subjects, including Corporate Law, Arbitration, Information Technology Law, Intellectual Property Rights, Law and Social Transformation, and emerging disciplines like Gender Studies and Feminist Jurisprudence. Teaching methodology is interactive, focusing on real-world application over rote learning. Many faculty members have cleared NET and are pursuing or have completed PhDs.",

Annual sports events are also organized, including chess, badminton, running, and group sports.

But there are tutorial classes as well where students can ask as many doubts as they can, and the ratio is 1:25. Overall, it's very easy to communicate. To be honest, till now every faculty I have met is amazing, sweet, generous, and very educated. There are many exams, mainly MSTs, tests, and sessional. Sessionals are comparatively easy, but MST and EST are tough. Majority of the students pass the exams, and very few get stuck. Curriculum mostly gets changed every year to match what's going on in upcoming years. There are very useful sessions that not only help us in academics but also in daily problems. Exams take place frequently here. Timings are 2 hours for MST,  3 hours for EST, and 15 minutes for sessional. The difficulty level is moderate."

There is a subject named IOT for students, which is very helpful. We make projects in IOT, which helps us to learn about so many new things.

Sometimes it got tough to get attention from the faculty members, as there were a lot of students (around 1,000) in the computer science branch alone. It also impacted the placements quite a bit.

Around 10% of students got internships, and the companies are Zepto, Thermopads, Zen Technologies, etc. The top role offered in my course is VLSI and embedded engineer at present.",
              "Infrastructure": "Facilities and infrastructure of my department are top-notch. They include good Wi-Fi, lab equipments, classrooms, clean washrooms, drinking water, and also an excellent library for learning. There is an issue regarding the campus hostels' food which is very unclean but now they offer quite good food only. The canteen, medical facilities, and sports are also top-notch.",
              "Faculty": "Teachers are highly-qualified, very helpful, and also qualified. The teaching quality is so pure. Students gain very good knowledge from their lectures. This course curriculum is relevant, and makes the students industry-ready. I don't feel very difficult in semester exams, the difficulty rate is 10% or maybe not that too if we concentrate on lectures and don't waste time. The pass percentage is around 70%. The faculty in my department are very friendly and easy to interact. They help to clarify students' doubts.",
              "Other": "I chose this course because I feel I am connected to it. I also love interacting with hardware components, and chose to do so under my sister's guidance. The best thing about my course is interacting with hardware components, and also sometimes software. The things I wish would be improved about my course are maybe having more practical knowledge than theoretical knowledge. My college is known for events, fests, and extra activities other than academics. Connectivity, campus crowd, and surroundings are good but scholarship is still not allotted by the government to few batches."

But coming to the academics, it is somewhat like a downgrade.

Overall, the campus is very beautiful, and academics are somewhat low, placements are very high, and they train us very well. Coming to the extracurricular activities, they are well encouraged."

Students are very stressed, and many have backlogs. They tell us to study very hard to get placed. Few MNCs come to our college for placements.",
              "Infrastructure": "When it rains, the college looks like a swimming pool. Wi-Fi facility is very slow, and systems are also very slow, so it needs frequent repair. Ethernet cables are not working, but the indoor system is good with marbles. Corridors are also good, but the water storage system needs to be improved.",
              "Faculty": "Many teachers are jolly and strict. Many of them do not have proper knowledge. They only refer to ChatGPT or textbooks, but we expected more from them. Many teachers are rude and shout unnecessarily. They take strict action unnecessarily, but everything is good.",
              "Other": "The best thing about my course is good friends, but not everyone. There is no unity at all. Few fests are organised, and we do not get permission most of the time for fests."

The top role offered is a software engineer.",

We have to pay some amount of fees, and they also prepare us for aptitude, reasoning and technical purposes, and I am very thankful to the placements department, and I got an internship in the 3rd year only.

The CSIT branch is like heaven for every student in our college.",

We have to follow JNTU rules, and also, we cannot call them industry-ready courses. Faculty of our branch is very well, and also they teach industry-related things. But the syllabus does not have the current updated content in it.",

After that, I realised that the CSIT department is very good for me, like Computer Science and Information Technology, which helped me to get an internship. There are so many events in our college that are very enjoyable and technical, and also very good. The campus crowd is not good because there are so many fights between the students, etc."

The majority of students get placed in service-based companies, including TCS, Wipro, Infosys, HCL, Accenture, Cognizant, Capgemini, and Tech Mahindra. These companies offer packages ranging from 3.6 to 6 LPA. Only a handful of product-based companies visit these private colleges and cherry-pick 2-3 students per college. It is the reality of all private colleges, not just our college. If you want to crack a high-paying job, you will have to do it off-campus.",
              "Infrastructure": "Our college has decent infrastructure compared to other government colleges in West Bengal. However, there are a few problems. There is no AC in classrooms or labs (except the computer labs), so it gets hot in the summer. The ground is quite small, barely enough to host one sporting event. All labs have equipment, but some of the apparatus is old. The college looks good from the inside, especially the ground floor, but the lack of AC is a big issue during the summer. The hostel has very limited seats, and rooms accommodate 2, 3, or 4 people. The food is just barely edible.",

Many faculty members in the college literally don't care about their students. They just come with their notebooks, read some topics from their notes, and leave the class. Some teachers just come to fill the chalkboard and explain nothing. However, there are also some faculty members who try their best to explain each and every topic to their students. The course curriculum is irrelevant in all colleges for getting a job. Exams are easy.",
              "Other": "I chose this college because it was the best option among all the others I got. The best perk is that it is an autonomous college, so there is no strict attendance policy, and the exams are very easy, making it easier to get a high CGPA. I chose IT because I couldn't get into CSE. I didn't choose any specialization because I wanted to do a non-specialized course. I wish they would install AC in all classrooms because it gets hot and humid during the April-June season. I also want the college to bring in better companies (PBC companies)."

              "Infrastructure": "For our department, there are dedicated Wi-Fi routers, labs are used by many other departments (shared labs). There is a dedicated classroom for our department but it changes every semester. There is also a library with a collection of more than 11000 books and a public room for reading. Hostel infrastructure is average (do not expect much), the food is decent (chicken is on Sunday), and after 10:00 PM the gate of the hostel closes. Medical facilities are there. Sports are conducted in college grounds during annual sports, and games are conducted in the premises of college campus.",
              "Faculty": "Teachers are helpful, they show the things that students have doubts. They are very much qualified (some teachers have more than 20 years of teaching experience at this college). They are very much knowledgeable. This course curriculum is relevant as you will learn about the core fundamentals of electronics which makes you proficient in both software and hardware industries. The exams are somewhat difficult (if you learn the concepts, you are ready for the exam). The pass percentage is about 75-85%."

If you want a good salary, you have to work hard and try to get it from outside the campus. The same goes for internships. You need to put in extra effort and secure them off-campus. Building strong skills and networking early can significantly improve your chances.",

You can't get a hostel inside the campus; it is located outside but managed by the college faculty. Free Wi-Fi is also available in the hostel. The food is just okay, not very good. Overall, the campus provides the basic necessities, but there is room for improvement in living conditions and facilities.",

They are supportive when it comes to clearing doubts. The course curriculum is moderately relevant. It covers the basic foundation needed in the industry. Semester exams are not very difficult if you attend classes regularly and study consistently. Questions are mostly based on classroom lectures and past papers. The pass percentage is quite high, usually around 85-90%, so it's manageable for most students.",
              "Other": "The best thing about the campus is that if you're surrounded by competitive and motivated students, you naturally grow and improve yourself. Although they claim to have a gym on the campus, it's either not available for students or remains closed most of the time. Even the student lift is often out of service, which can be convenient. On the brighter side, the college organizes enjoyable fests, offers scholarships, and provides various extracurricular activities you can participate in. With the right mindset and involvement, you can make the most of what the campus offers despite its limitations."

The facilities provided by the college are Wi-Fi, labs, a common room, Gymkhana and many other things. There are 5 boys hostels and 2 girls hostels, of which one is under construction. But there are no canteen facilities and the mess quality is also average or, at times, below average.",
              "Faculty": "The faculty members are very helpful and supportive. Most young faculty are quite helpful and good in teaching and they will help you if you want help regarding higher education, placement, internships, etc. If you are tortured by senior, you can complain they will immediately help you.",
              "Other": "Metallurgy and Materials Engineering is the best course in this college and if you want to prepare for higher studies like an MBA or GATE, then seniors will help you. The mess should be improved."

              "Placements": "NIFFT boasts a track record in placement. Due to its emphasis on core branches such as metallurgy and manufacturing, most placements are secured by students in core companies. Individual attention is given to each student, resulting in an almost perfect placement rate. In 2023, the average package was 7 LPA. Notable recruiting companies at NIFFT include Tata Steel, Heavy Engineering Corporation, NML, IOCL, ONGC, Vedanta, JSW and others.",
              "Infrastructure": "The college may be on 65 acres when compared to institutes but its campus is well planned and fully utilized. The labs, classrooms, instruments and equipment are all in good condition and equipped with modern facilities. There are four boy hostels and one girl hostel on the campus. The hostels provide a range of amenities, such as 24-hour Wi-Fi, round-the-clock electricity supply, equipped common rooms and nicely furnished rooms. Additionally, the college offers mess and canteen services that are reasonably priced.",
              "Faculty": "The professors at this institution have credentials holding Ph.D. degrees from universities such as IITs, NITs and international institutions. They are known to be very supportive and primarily conduct classes in English  to cater to the student population coming from parts of India. NIFFT is recognised for its programs in fields like metallurgy and mechanical engineering. Recently, two new disciplines have been introduced: computer engineering and production & industrial engineering. Admission to these B.Tech. courses is based on the JEE Main Rankings administered by the NTA.",
              "Other": "The college is quite impressive in terms of placement and infrastructure. The main thing about the college is that it provides all the facilities at very reasonable prices. Overall, it is a good place for learning and having splendid memories. If we talk about cons, the college is located in Hatia, a small town in Ranchi, so it does not provide good connectivity for transport. The other thing is that NIFFT doesn't have any impressive clubs or societies, so it lags in terms of exposure and crowds."

The highest package was 16 LPA, and many students received 13.6 LPA from Vedanta and JSW. Additionally, as always, companies like JSW offered 9.6 LPA and hired in bulk. Therefore, the average package is between 9 to 10 LPA, which is quite good for Metallurgy and Materials Engineering as a fresher.",
              "Infrastructure": "The infrastructure is not that great, but it is well-maintained. There are a total of 7 hostels: 5 boys' hostels and 2 girls' hostels. Each year has a separate hostel for boys, so there is not much ragging. Each hostel has a large common room with a big TV, table tennis, and many indoor games. The 1st-year hostel has 4 grounds inside, including a badminton court, volleyball court, and cricket area. Wi-Fi is available in the hostel 24/7. There is also a library for studying or borrowing books.",
              "Faculty": "The faculty are very helpful and knowledgeable as well. If you need any assistance with internships or preparation for the GATE exam, they will help you. There are a total of eight semesters and sixteen midsems; each semester has two midsems, and the best of the two will be chosen."

There is a group of students participating in an inter-NIT competition."

Students who follow the courses properly in skills get entry-level jobs. They provide extra practice and internships, which help in becoming fully industry-ready. Samiksha's semester exams are moderate but not too hard. The pass percentage is usually around 72-85% depending on the subject and the batch of students.",

If we do not get it even after the repeated explanation, they will explain it to us in 1 to 1 interaction in the staffroom. Exams are conducted and verified in our college itself, so the papers will be set by our faculty members themselves, as our college is an autonomous college.",

Infosys, Accenture, Capgemini, Cognizant, and TCS are the main companies involved. There is a very low percentage of students who get real internships; most of them get them in their last year, just because. The students who get internships are the ones who get it based on their skills and themselves through the connections they make at events. SDE, UI/UX Developer, and Data Science will be offered when we graduate.",

Only 2 chapatis in the afternoon. The canteen is open till 5.",

Wi-Fi facility is provided throughout our campus, little problem with it in the hostel. Library is also good, we can take 3 books from there at a time. Canteen is average. Hostel is not so good for non-native students because most of the dishes are local food itself, and the rooms are average.",

You are provided with question banks a month before the end-of-semester exam, which is the only written exam that takes place in the entire semester.

The campus is well-connected by public transport, and we have scholarships like Jagananna Vidya Deevena."

There is a clinic on the campus, which is free of charge for a consultation. The hostels are strict, you cannot go outside without your parents permission. You need to take it every time you go out. The food is below average.",

The sports and games area is also decent.",

The curriculum is good, but it doesn't compare to the NEP curriculum. It, however, does do the job and makes the student industry-ready as long as the student puts in the effort to understand the subjects in the course. The semester exam questions feel fair enough."

Restrooms were not very clean. Overall, the hostel facilities were not good.",

Companies like Zoho (4.5 LPA), TCS (3.3 LPA), Tech Mahindra (3.25 LPA), and L&T Infotech (3 LPA) frequently visited my college. Many other companies were yet to come. Till now, 410 students have been placed in my college.",

Also, for master students, there was an option for choosing soft core courses from other departments to get more credit. Hostel could provide a good environment for the students. In the hostel, four students could share one room. The meal quality was average in the hostel. The hostel cost was little expensive. Overall, the hostel facility was average on our campus.",

In case of a medical emergency, they provide a check-up at a nearby hospital, or else students can go home. The canteen will not meet the expectations. The food is very nice.",

Around 10 students are only placed in top MNCs. The percentage of placements is better in our college than in other colleges. The top roles offered are software developer, analyst, web testing, web development fields, etc. They share placement information on a daily basis. For placements, the college is very good.",

The maintenance of the hostel is very good and neat with all facilities. In sports, students join through the TNEA sports quota as there are facilities. But they do not encourage the students for training and other competition purposes, which is the main disadvantage of this college. Wi-Fi and food facilities are excellent, well-maintained, and clean.",

Most of the teachers are informative of students, and they clarify doubts. The course curriculum of the college is very much related to company requirements. There are COE courses to learn on behalf of specific company requirements based on the student's performance, and the COE official companies hire the students. They are more friendly with students.",
              "Other": "In our batch, all the departments except mechanical departments around 550 students get admitted to the college. Most of the students get admitted through TNEA counseling. Admission through counseling is very best for college admission. The campus crowd is minimal. Scholarships are provided for first-year graduate students and other government schemes are valid in college admission, and they are valid only for TNEA admission through government Quota. I suggest students get admission through the government quota."

Their quality of teaching is moderate. The course curriculum is relevant and the objective is clear with prerequisite well-learned. The course curriculum is updated with industry-required skills and knowledge. The end-semester exam is a little tough to clear. Exams are conducted frequently like 2 sets of exams per month. The internal exams are also tough, and the pass percentage is about 70%.",

The learning experience of exploring new teaching is the best thing about this course. Our college should focus more on practical learning than theory subjects. Few technical events are conducted yearly, and the campus crowd is about 2000 students. The connectivity is good, and many students are from Andhra Pradesh and Telangana, so exposure is good on this campus. Extracurricular activities are very few and conducted for namesake."

The percent of students placed in my department is around 25% because it is relatively easy to learn Data Science compared to other AI fields like machine learning.

In the case of college infrastructure, they have Wi-Fi everywhere, so no problem with that. Classes are also fully air-conditioned with smart lab facilities, etc.",
              "Faculty": "Teachers are good, but not great, I would say, because it's a new field, my college didn't have that much experienced staff for my course. The curriculum is relevant, but that much great teaching involved because they by themself didn't know much. Semesters are pretty easy, without studying itself, you pass the subject, even if you can get an A+ grade if you are lucky. The pass percentage is 95%.",

It would be better if they also focused on the fun side. It's our only college life, but I didn't enjoy it that much in college, other than studying. It has an average crowd, I wold say there is not much of crowd, but it is not so empty either."

              "Placements": "The placement scene is quite good; based on my observations, it’s above 90% with many people placed in JP Morgan, UBS, ZS, and other prominent companies. Furthermore, the placement cell is very helpful and assists in many fields. In addition to placements, there is also an internship fair conducted to give students the opportunity to gain experience.",
              "Infrastructure": "The infrastructure consists of a six-story building. There is no ground or any area for sports, but considering the college's location, it is acceptable. The entire college is air-conditioned except for the corridors. There are labs for many subjects, and the canteen is also quite good. As for the hostel, the college doesn’t have one but is affiliated with a nearby option. However, I honestly wouldn’t recommend it as it’s very expensive, and you’ll have a better chance of finding another one.",
              "Faculty": "The teachers are very helpful and offer great assistance in academics, and the curriculum is practical. Exams are also reasonable, and you get enough time to prepare for them. Teachers also help during exams by providing study materials. The passing percentage is reasonable at around 35%, and it's not that difficult to score.",
              "Other": "In addition to academics, the college also organizes various activities, including fests, hackathons, and other club activities. The college has a large variety of clubs that will suit your needs. It would have been better if there was an area for sports and other activities, but other than that, it’s pretty good."

The main advantage we have over others is that we are allowed to prepare for competitive exams like GATE and GRE while sitting for certain interviews (not for dream jobs and above). This option is not available in most colleges.",
              "Infrastructure": "Labs all have centralized AC and all the required software. The lab in charge is polite and experienced. Hostels are a bit costly compared to the services they provide. There are many stores and options to eat in the area, so students from outside have many options.",
              "Faculty": "Faculty are very experienced with the required amount of qualifications. Though the exams are hard, they help you in the long run. Even internal marks are hard to get, as teachers are very particular about labs and the assignments given. The course has all the required subjects related to the field you have selected.",
              "Other": "The college overall is good, but don't expect much from the cultural fest, as the management is very bad. You can always go to the fests at the neighboring SVKM college, though. It is a great college to study and helps you start your career on the right track."

The curriculum itself was well-designed, with ample choice in electric forces that were nearly aligned with industry standards. In my fifth semester, I had the option to choose an honours or minors degree. I chose the honours degree, which is an additional degree in addition to my BTech in computer engineering. It spans four semesters. Exams are fairly easy to score well on if we study a week or so before. To get a 10 CGPA, we need a 90% in a particular subject; for a 9 CGPA, we need an 80%. It's quite easy to score a 9 to 9.5 CGPA if we study a week or 10 days before."
